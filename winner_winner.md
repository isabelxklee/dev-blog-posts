## App launch
Last week, I launched a random name picker app called [Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner!](https://www.winnerwinnerapp.com) It's a lightweight React app that uses localStorage to store the user's data.

## The story behind Winner Winner
As a software engineering coach at Flatiron School, I lead several meetings a week where I have to pick on students to participate. We usually do a popcorn-style rotation where the person who just participated picks the next person to go. But with 25 students and 4 instructors in the class, it can be tedious taking account of who's already gone and who's still left.

One of my goals this year is to become a stronger frontend developer and become more familiar with JavaScript frameworks. I love working with React and Redux, so I decided to give myself a short deadline of building a single-page app using React and [styled components](https://styled-components.com).

## What would I do differently next time?
* Would've picked an easier dataset to work with if I knew how tricky it was going to be to load +7,000 data points (lol!)
* Would've done more research on different React tools for the Mapbox API before committing to the first one that I found and constantly refactoring my code
* Would've reached out for help earlier from my colleagues!
