## Intro
If there are differences in the code between the branches, there will be a merge conflict.

## How to set up the Mapbox API with a React app
* Create an account
* Create a new token (don't use the default token)
* Set URL restrictions
* ...
* Hide your API key
* Add customizations!
* If you deploy your project, add your API key in the deployment settings; .env file will not be pushed up if you're using a GitHub pipeline

## Learnings
* Would've picked an easier dataset to work with if I knew how tricky it was going to be to load +7,000 data points (lol!)
* Would've done more research on different React tools for the Mapbox API before committing to the first one that I found and constantly refactoring my code
* Would've reached out for help earlier from my colleagues!
