## Commands
#### git add
Adds any files that have been changed to the staging zone...

#### git commit
Saves a snapshot of your work. It's like a checkpoint that you can always revert back to. All commits are accessible on your repository and you can see the exact changes that you made.

#### git push
Sends all your commit back up to GitHub so that your work isn't just living on your local machine. This command updates your remote repository to match your local version. 

#### git pull
Updates your local machine with any changes that have been made to your repository remotely. For example, if you're working with a partner, `git pull` will update your local repository with any changes that your partner has pushed up to GitHub.

#### git remote -v
Adds any files that have been changed to the staging zone...

#### git status
Adds any files that have been changed to the staging zone...

## Terminology
#### Repository
A directory or folder where your code lives.

#### Remote
The version of your repository that lives on GitHub's server and is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. If you have a private repository, other people won't be able to access your code, but you can still access it from different machines.

#### Local
The version of your repository that lives on your computer. This may or may not be the same as your remote repository, as it depends on the last time you pushed up to GitHub or pulled down from it.

#### Fork
Forking a repository makes a copy of it and lives on your GitHub account. For example, if I forked Sylwia's project called `sylwia/dismantle-the-patriarchy`, it would create a new repository on my account, as `isabelxklee/dismantle-the-patriarchy`

#### Clone
Cloning a repository does *not* make a copy, but instead directly downloads on to your local machine.
